          As a speaker I always struggle to find all the CFPs that are out there. When I get notified about an awesome event, it's usually too late and the CFP is already closed! 👎<br /><br />
          In an attempt to overcome this I, <a href="https://gerald.verslu.is" target="_blank">Gerald Versluis</a>, have created this website! With this application I would like to provide you with a portal
that allows you to submit any CFP to any event, but maybe even more important: enable you to find open CFPs to awesome events! WHOA!<br /><br />
If you have reached this website right now, you're a bit too early. I'm busy setting things up. But in the meanwhile please don't hesitate to let me know what you think and reach out to me at <a href="mailto:gerald@verslu.is">gerald@verslu.is</a> or Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/jfversluis" target="_blank">@@jfversluis</a>.
